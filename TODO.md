# TODO - Ranked Choice Poll App

## Next Items to Implement

- [x] Make sure title/description placeholders go back to their placeholder text if a title is added then deleted
- [x] Fix placeholder logic, width issues, and ensure proper fallback behavior
- [ ] Move "Your poll is live and ready to share" to the bottom center for all screen widths
- [ ] Make the header a deeper red/pink than the main background, not lighter
- [ ] Replace "Share" with the conventional share icon
- [ ] Add "Start a new poll" link text in the header next to "Ranked Choice"
- [ ] Modify the routing so that "/" redirects to a page like "/QPVO/edit" where QPVO is a random generated 4 letters. The current /home UI will become the UI shown on that page.
- [ ] Beside the "Share" button add a "Go To Poll" button (it won't do anything yet).

## Notes
- We'll tackle these one by one
- Current /home UI will become the edit page UI
- Need to implement random 4-letter code generation
- Routing changes will require new page components
